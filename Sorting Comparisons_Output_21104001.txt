COMPARISON BETWEEN INSERTION AND BUBBLE SORT.

1. ON THE BASIS OF NUMBER OF COMPARISONS :  BOTH REQUIRE EQUAL NUMBER OF COMPARISONS.

2. ON THE BASIS OF NUMBE ROF SWAPS :  BOTH REQUIRE EQUAL NUMBER OF SWAPS.

3 . As both BubbleSort and SelectionSort are In-place algorithms, hence both of their Inplace Algorithms have been written above
